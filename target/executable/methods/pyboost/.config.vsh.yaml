    \ regression-based recommender system)\n* ExtraTrees (a decision tree ensemble\
    \ with target-encoded features)\n* a k-nearest neighbors recommender system\n\
    * a ridge regression model\n\nEach model offered distinct strengths and weaknesses:\
    \ ExtraTrees and\nknn were unable to extrapolate beyond the training data, while\
    \ ridge\nregression provided extrapolation capability. To enhance model performance,\n\
    data augmentation techniques were used, including averaging differential\nexpressions\
