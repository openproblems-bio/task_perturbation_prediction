    description: "The prediction system is two staged, so I publish two versions of\
      \ the notebook.\nThe first stage predicts pseudolabels. To be honest, if I stopped\
      \ on this version, I would not be the third.\nThe predicted pseudolabels on\
      \ all test data (255 rows) are added to training in the second stage.\n\n**Stage\
      \ 1 preparing pseudolabels**: The main part of this system is a neural network.\
      \ Every neural network and its environment was optimized by optuna. Hyperparameters\
      \ that have been optimized:\na dropout value, a number of neurons in particular\
      \ layers, an output dimension of an embedding layer, a number of epochs, a learning\
      \ rate, a batch size, a number of dimension of truncated singular value decomposition.\n\
      The optimization was done on custom 4-folds cross validation. In order to avoid\
      \ overfitting to cross validation by optuna I applied 2 repeats for every fold\
      \ and took an average. Generally, the more, the better. The optuna's criterion\
      \ was MRRMSE.\nFinally, 7 models were ensembled. Optuna was applied again to\
      \ determine best weights of linear combination. The prediction of test set is\
      \ the pseudolabels now and will be used in second stage.\n\n**Stage 2 retraining\
      \ with pseudolabels**: The pseudolabels (255 rows) were added to the training\
      \ dataset. I applied 20 models with optimized parameters in different experiments\
      \ for a model diversity.\nOptuna selected optimal weights for the linear combination\
      \ of the prediction again.\nModels had high variance, so every model was trained\
      \ 10 times on all dataset and the median of prediction is taken as a final prediction.\
      \ The prediction was additionally clipped to colwise min and max. \n"
