  summary: "Predicting how small molecules change gene expression in different cell\
    \ types."
  description: "Human biology can be complex, in part due to the function and interplay\
    \ of the body's\napproximately 37 trillion cells, which are organized into tissues,\
    \ organs, and systems.\nHowever, recent advances in single-cell technologies have\
    \ provided unparalleled insight\ninto the function of cells and tissues at the\
    \ level of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Yet\nleveraging single-cell methods to develop\
    \ medicines requires mapping causal links\nbetween chemical perturbations and\
    \ the downstream impact on cell state. These experiments\nare costly and labor\
    \ intensive, and not all cells and tissues are amenable to\nhigh-throughput transcriptomic\
    \ screening. If data science could help accurately predict\nchemical perturbations\
    \ in new cell types, it could accelerate and expand the development\nof new medicines.\n\
    \nSeveral methods have been developed for drug perturbation prediction, most of\
    \ which are\nvariations on the autoencoder architecture (Dr.VAE, scGEN, and ChemCPA).\
    \ However, these\nmethods lack proper benchmarking datasets with diverse cell\
    \ types to determine how well\nthey generalize. The largest available training\
    \ dataset is the NIH-funded Connectivity\nMap (CMap), which comprises over 1.3M\
    \ small molecule perturbation measurements. However,\nthe CMap includes observations\
    \ of only 978 genes, less than 5% of all genes. Furthermore,\nthe CMap data is\
    \ comprised almost entirely of measurements in cancer cell lines, which\nmay not\
    \ accurately represent human biology.\n\nThis task aims to predict how small molecules\
    \ change gene expression in different cell\ntypes. This task was a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations/overview)\n\
    as part of the [NeurIPS 2023 competition track](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/competition/66586).\n\
    \nThe task is to predict the gene expression profile of a cell after a small molecule\n\
    perturbation. For this competition, we designed and generated a novel single-cell\n\
    perturbational dataset in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We\n\
    selected 144 compounds from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures\n\
    (LINCS) Connectivity Map dataset ([PMID: 29195078](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195078/))\n\
    and measured single-cell gene\nexpression profiles after 24 hours of treatment.\
    \ The experiment was repeated in three\nhealthy human donors, and the compounds\
    \ were selected based on diverse transcriptional\nsignatures observed in CD34+\
    \ hematopoietic stem cells (data not released). We performed\nthis experiment\
    \ in human PBMCs because the cells are commercially available with\npre-obtained\
    \ consent for public release and PBMCs are a primary, disease-relevant tissue\n\
    that contains multiple mature cell types (including T-cells, B-cells, myeloid\
    \ cells,\nand NK cells) with established markers for annotation of cell types.\
    \ To supplement this\ndataset, we also measured cells from each donor at baseline\
    \ with joint scRNA and\nsingle-cell chromatin accessibility measurements using\
    \ the 10x Multiome assay. We hope\nthat the addition of rich multi-omic data for\
    \ each donor and cell type at baseline will\nhelp establish biological priors\
    \ that explain the susceptibility of particular genes to\nexhibit perturbation\
    \ responses in difference biological contexts.\n"
