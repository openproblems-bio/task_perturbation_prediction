    summary: "Py-boost predicting t-scores"
    description: |
      An ensemble of four models was considered: 
      
      * Py-boost (a ridge regression-based recommender system)
      * ExtraTrees (a decision tree ensemble with target-encoded features)
      * a k-nearest neighbors recommender system
      * a ridge regression model

      Each model offered distinct strengths and weaknesses: ExtraTrees and
      knn were unable to extrapolate beyond the training data, while ridge
      regression provided extrapolation capability. To enhance model performance,
      data augmentation techniques were used, including averaging differential
      expressions for compound mixtures and adjusting cell counts to reduce biases.

      In the end, only the py-boost model is used for generating predictions.
